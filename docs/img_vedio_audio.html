     <p> A flower is the reproductive structure of flowering plants, also known as blooms or blossoms. They are typically colorful and attract pollinators like insects or birds, facilitating the process of seed production. Flowers consist of various parts, including petals, sepals, stamens, and pistils, each with a specific role in reproduction. They can be found individually or in clusters called inflorescences</p>
